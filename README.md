## About Me üìö

Throughout my educational journey, I have actively pursued a diverse range of interests, showcasing my motivation to excel in various fields. Starting with a Nitec in Digital Audio and Video Production, I gained valuable experience in digital media. I then attended a Diploma in Screen Media, where I honed my creative skills. Driven by my curiosity and enthusiasm, I continued my studies by obtaining a Higher Nitec in Electronics Engineering and am currently pursuing a Diploma in Computer Engineering.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I spent two years in national service, serving with the Coast Guard. This experience not only instilled discipline and resilience in me, but also allowed me to develop strong teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills in high-pressure situations. These abilities have further enhanced my transdisciplinary skill set.

This unique combination of experiences has equipped me with the ability to approach challenges from various angles and develop innovative solutions. For instance, my background in digital media production allows me to create visually appealing presentations and user interfaces for my computer and electronics engineering projects. At the same time, my technical skills in electronics and computer engineering provide a solid foundation to implement advanced features and optimize performance in media production projects.
